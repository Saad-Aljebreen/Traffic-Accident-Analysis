## Introduction:

In this project we're going to take a look at the number of traffic accidents and driving licenses issued in Saudi Arabia. We'll seek to identify trends in the data and combine our data analysis with outside research to identify likely factors influencing the outcomes of traffic accidents in the various regions in Saudi Arabia.

### Problem Statment:
Does the incress of driving license issued affect the number of traffic accident?

### Executive Summary:
By analysing the driving licenses and traffic accidents datasets we'll gain insight about Saudi traffic. Which'll help us to identify the reasons of accidents in the regions that has the highest driving licenses and traffic accidents.

### Data Dictionary:

|Feature|Type|Dataset|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|Year|int|Traffic_Accidents|This is for determine in which year the accidents occurred| 
|State|object|Traffic_Accidents|This is to specify which region| 
|Indicator|object|Traffic_Accidents|This is to give you brief about the accident| 
|Value|int|Traffic_Accidents|This is to give you number of accidents occurred in this region| 
|Latitude|float|Traffic_Accidents|This is to specify the latitude|
|Longitude|float|Traffic_Accidents|This is to specify the longitude|
|Year|int|Driving_Licenses|This is for determine in which year the license issued| 
|State|object|Driving_Licenses|This is to specify which region the license issued| 
|Driving_liceses|int|Driving_Licenses|This is to give you number of liceses	 issued in this region| 
|Latitude|float|Driving_Licenses|This is to specify the latitude|
|Longitude|float|Driving_Licenses|This is to specify the longitude|


### Conclusions and Recommendations:
I found that there are 3 regions that has highest traffic accedint and driving licence which are:

    - Riyadh: Because it is the capital of KSA and has around 8 milion people live in.
    - Makkah that refeer to the seasonality (Hajj and Omrah) I recond to use the puplic transporation in Makkah.
    - Eastren Region: is the 3rd bigest region that is normal.
    
    
I recommend to active the puplic transportaion, strict traffic laws, prevent the traks from enter the cities and Street expansion.
Increes number of traffic officer the hgihest region.

There are a lot of feature wil improve the analysis such as driver age and gender, which date and time the accident ocured.
